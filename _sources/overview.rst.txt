What is the DaCapo Toolbox?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DaCapo Toolbox contains the building blocks that the DaCapo framework uses to run training
for large scale volumetric deep learning.

These include:
- Architectures: Configurable classes for building common neural networks such as UNets
- DataSplits: Configurable classes for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets
- Tasks: Configurable classes for defining transformations between ground truth and differentiable targets and back
- Trainers: Configurable classes for defining augmentations
